Creating a springboot application that leverage a NoSQL DB(mongoDb). A learning/practice exercise for myself to get more hands on reps with java. 
This is only a back-end for now. Will be adding a UI that proxy's the back-end port and allows you to communicate with the back-end locally.


If you're use IntelliJ you can simply use the run button to startthe backend server. If you are using vscode or another IDE cd into the server folder and run this command ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
